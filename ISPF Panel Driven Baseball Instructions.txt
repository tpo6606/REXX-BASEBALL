BASE1 - Has the basics needed to display a ISPF Panel.
Make note of the two ISPEXEC commands
LIBDEF is only needed once at the top to tell where the Panels are located.
DISPLAY does just that, Displays the Panel.  It would be in your loop.  With PF3 or you could a value to EXIT as well.
You would need to set the DIAM1-7 variables (or add more) each time the base runners move.

PANBASE1 - Is just the start of a Panel for the game.
I framed the DIAM display because it did not retain leading spaces for some reason.
Update the Options section
Add lines for Outs, Count, etc....
Use the )ATTR values to play with colors.

PANSYS1 - This is a more involved Panel with lots of things you can do.
This does not have the driving program, however.  Just syntax of things.

We can have a working session to help with questions. 

Note: Sometimes when making Panel changes, you need to exit ISPF (back to READY prompt), for the changes to be picked up.  Not always though.  I could never figure out when.
ISPF from READY gets you back in.
